Hello,

I wanted to keep the code simple.
That's why only used one box for the left and right side of the scale bowl.
On the other hand in my "FirstPage_BowlIndex" class I initialized all box elements (They can be used to improve the code later).

Please Use "CucumberRunner" Class to run the Code.
At the end, code will wait 10 seconds and then close the browser.

I am using this project file for interviews. That is why I have other dependencies in my pom.xml
such as: rest assured, Appium, Apache POI etc.
